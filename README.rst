Titanium Training Docs
----------------------

These docs where prepared for a 6 days immersion training in mobile apps development with Titanium. 

This training is focused on Titanium, but also includes JavaScript methodology, design strategy and specific platform issues.

I use a lot of samples and real code to demonstrate each concept in classroom. Not all of these samples are in the slides and most of them are 
developed "in real time" for the class. Often the slides serves me as a guideline and the explanations are done over the screen. Every tutor should
have their own samples and resources, so DO NOT LIMIT to the contents of these slides and extend as you consider. Use them as what they are, just a guideline
to help you speak about all you want to speak.
